Version: 3.0 (December 30, 2025)
The paper conducts the first sensitivity audit and rank volatility analysis of India’s State Energy and Climate Index (SECI Round 1, 2022), identifying methodological biases (e.g., 40% weight on DISCOMs) and recommending recalibration for Net-Zero alignment. Key findings include high rank fragility (Kendall's τ < 0.80 below 20% DISCOM), literacy as an enabler (OLS β = 0.612, p < 0.01), and a "green paradox" via mediation analysis (95% indirect effect of forest cover through literacy).
The repository supports full reproducibility of simulations, regressions, mediation, VIF diagnostics, and robustness checks (e.g., using NFHS-5 and GGI proxies).

Repository Structure

Reassessing India's SECI.pdf / Reassessing India's SECI.docx: The full paper manuscript (enhanced version).
data/: Raw and processed data files (CSVs).
seci_rankings.csv: Original SECI Round 1 scores and parameters for 28 states (n=28; source: NITI Aayog, 2022). Columns: Rank, States/UTs, DISCOM's Performance, Access affordability & reliability, Clean Energy Initiatives, Energy Efficiency, Env Sustainability, New Initiatives, SECI score.
clean_socio_economic_data.csv: Socio-economic variables (~2019–2022) for regressions (n=27; missing Manipur due to data gaps). Columns: State, Per_Capita_Income_thou, Literacy_pct, Poverty_pct, Industrial_Share_pct, Forest_pct.
nfhs5_human_capital_proxies.csv: NFHS-5 (2019–21) proxies for literacy/human capital robustness checks (n=27). Columns: State, Mean_Years_Schooling, Women_10plus_Yrs_Schooling_pct, Households_Internet_pct.
ggi_proxy.csv: Good Governance Index (GGI) 2021 proxies for additional robustness (n=27). Columns: State, GGI_Group, GGI_Rank_In_Group, GGI_Proxy_Normalized (normalized 0–1 scale within groups for cross-comparison).

code/: Python scripts for replication.
reproduce_all.py: Main script to run all analyses (simulations, OLS, mediation, VIF, robustness). Outputs tables/figures to replication_outputs/.
Other helpers (e.g., for fragility audits, Kendall's τ calculations).

replication_outputs/: Generated results (e.g., tables as CSVs, figures as PNGs). Empty initially; populated by running code.
README.md: This file.
requirements.txt: Python dependencies (e.g., pandas, statsmodels, scipy, matplotlib).

How to Reproduce the Results

Environment Setup:
Python 3.8+ (tested on 3.12).
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (includes numpy, pandas, scipy, statsmodels, matplotlib, scikit-learn for mediation/VIF).

Running the Code:
Execute python code/reproduce_all.py.
This loads CSVs from data/.
Performs:
Simulations: Weight stress tests (40%, 30%, 20%, 10% DISCOM; focused redistribution to CEI/EE/ES). Outputs Table A3 (rankings/scores), A4 (weights), A5 (shifts/clusters via K-means k=3).
Regressions: OLS on SECI score vs. socio-economic vars (n=27). Outputs β coefficients (e.g., literacy=0.612, p<0.01).
Mediation: Forest cover → Literacy → SECI (95% indirect effect).
Diagnostics: VIF (<4 for all vars, e.g., Poverty_pct=3.74).
Robustness: Re-run OLS with NFHS-5 proxies (stronger literacy effects) and GGI proxies (positive governance β).

Generates figures (e.g., volatility heatmaps, mediation paths) and tables in replication_outputs/.

All results match paper values exactly (e.g., τ=0.910 at 30%, 0.815 at 20%, 0.735 at 10%; Punjab drop 4→19 at 10%).

Notes on Data:
n=28 for simulations (all states from seci_rankings.csv, excluding UTs).
n=27 for regressions (Manipur missing in socio_economic_data.csv, nfhs5_human_capital_proxies.csv, ggi_proxy.csv due to source gaps).
Proxies: NFHS-5 for literacy sensitivity; GGI normalized for governance robustness.

Verification:
Independently audited: Code runs error-free; outputs verifiable against paper (e.g., exact β, τ, clusters).
For custom runs: Modify weights/thresholds in reproduce_all.py (e.g., τ cutoff=0.80).
