# Replication Package: India's SECI - DISCOM Weight Bias Analysis
# Core Problem: The NITI Aayog’s SECI (Round 1) has a "weight defect" where 40% of the total score is attributed solely to the financial performance of power distribution companies (DISCOMs). This imbalance rewards "structural legacy" rather than actual progress toward renewable energy and Net-Zero goals
This package reproduces all results from the paper "India’s SECI: A Shaky Ladder for India’s Sustainability and Net-Zero Climb".

## Files
- data.csv: State-wise SECI parameters, scores, socio-economic variables (sources: NITI Aayog 2022, ISFR 2023, NITI MPI 2023, MoSPI).
- replication_code.py: Simulations, ranks, Kendall Tau, K-means, OLS regressions, visuals.
- rank_shifts_top10.png & volatility_clusters.png: Generated figures.

## Run
python replication_code.py

Outputs match paper: Tau ~0.658 (10%), literacy significant, forest barrier, high volatility in 7 states.
