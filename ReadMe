#Reassessing India’s State Energy and Climate Index: Addressing Bias for Aligned Net-Zero Pathways
Data Integrity: "Socio-economic data is verified against FSI 2021 and NITI Aayog 2021 reports.
Sample Clarity: "We explicitly distinguish between the simulation universe (N=28) and the regression sample (n=27) to avoid bias."
Finding Transparency: "Contrary to bivariate correlations, Industrial Share is noted as non-significant in multivariate models; we prioritize Human Capital Depth as the primary explanatory variable."
