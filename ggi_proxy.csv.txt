#This CSV provides the Good Governance Index (GGI) 2021 proxy data used in the paper's robustness check.
# GGI_Group: The category from the official GGI 2020-21 report (Group A, Group B, or NE_Hill for North-East and Hill States).GGI_Rank_In_Group: Official rank within the group (lower number = better; sourced from the GGI report).GGI_Proxy_Normalized: Normalized proxy score (0–1 scale) created by scaling within each group to make scores comparable across groups (max in group = 1.00, then linear scaling based on rank positions). This matches the method described in the robustness subsection for fair cross-group comparison in regression analysis.
#Note: The official GGI report provides ranks within peer groups but no single cross-group composite score, hence the normalization for proxy use. Data derived from the official DARPG GGI 2020-21 report.
